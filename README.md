# TicTacToeinC#

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classical game that requires the participation of two players. With C#, you can build a simple tic-tac-toe game to strengthen your knowledge of C# programming. The tic-tac-toe game requires a 3 X 3 grid where players can mark ‘X’ and ‘O’. Firstly, the two need to decide which among them will choose Nought (O) and which one will choose Cross (X). Usually, the player who chose ‘X’ gets the first turn. The rules of the tic-tac-toe game are as follows:

-Only one player can mark their symbol (X or O) on a square within the grid at a time.
-The symbol put by one player cannot be overridden by the other player.
-The player who successfully puts their symbol in three consecutive squares, which may be horizontal, diagonal, or vertical, wins the game.
-If both the players are unable to put their respective symbols in three consecutive squares, the game will be a draw.
